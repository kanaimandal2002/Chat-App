# TCP Chat Application

A basic TCP-based chat application built with Node.js. The app supports multiple clients connecting to a server, where each message is broadcasted to all other connected clients. Each client is assigned a unique identifier like **Client 1**, **Client 2**, etc., and messages are logged accordingly.

## Features

- **Multiple Clients**: Connect multiple clients and exchange messages.
- **Client IDs**: Each client is assigned a unique ID (e.g., Client 1, Client 2).
- **Message Broadcasting**: Messages sent by one client are broadcasted to all other clients.
- **Graceful Disconnect**: Clients can disconnect gracefully without errors being logged unnecessarily.
- **Client Error Handling**: Handles client disconnections and errors appropriately.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js, but ensure itâ€™s up-to-date.
